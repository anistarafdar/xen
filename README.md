# Xen (Work In Process)

Xen (pronounced "zen"[5]), also referred to as the borderworld, is a separate overlapping dimension notably discovered by Black Mesa scientists, who regularly traveled there via portals to collect samples and study the myriad species of flora and fauna within. Xen is described as a "dimensional transit bottleneck--an area of continual contention."[6] It is the final retreat of Nihilanth's race, and a place to which most of the alien species appearing in the Half-Life series migrated to before coming to Earth during the Resonance Cascade.
