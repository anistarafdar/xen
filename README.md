# XEN

> interpreter for the XEN programming language

**Xen** (pronounced "zen"), is an interpreter for a Lisp-like programming language written in C for personal/educational purposes. As it's heavily inspired and based on the Lisp family of languages, it is very simple to use.

This project was written as an introduction to building programming languages, the Lisp family of languages, and C programming.
